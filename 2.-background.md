# 2. Background

Historically, investments in tangible assets like real estate, corporate equities, commodities, and businesses have been the domain of high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors due to high capital requirements and restricted access. Tokenization, however, revolutionizes this landscape by enabling fractional ownership. This innovation allows investors of all sizes to participate in a broader range of assets and business, democratizing access to previously exclusive investment opportunities.

**BICO** harnesses the power of blockchain technology to facilitate business tokenization. By representing these business as digital tokens on a blockchain, **BICO** enhances transparency, liquidity, and accessibility. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures a secure and immutable record of ownership, while tokenization allows for fractional ownership and seamless trading on secondary markets.
